You are an expert in creating challenging datasets for Vision Document Retrieval (VDR).
Your goal is to generate a **highly specific Korean search query** that acts as a realistic user prompt for retrieving information from a large corpus.

### 1. Document Context
The following XML-like tags contain the markdown text extracted from a sequence of document pages.
The `<document index="...">` tags are for your internal reasoning ONLY. **Do NOT mention these indices in the final query.**

<documents>
{% for doc in markdown %}
<document index="{{ loop.index0 }}">
{{ doc }}
</document>
{% endfor %}
</documents>

### 2. Task Requirements
You must generate a structured output containing the rationale and the query itself based on the following specifications:

* **Query Type**: {{ query_type }} ({{ query_type_definition }})
* **Query Format**: {{ query_format }} ({{ query_format_definition }})

### 3. Critical Constraints for Realistic Retrieval
To ensure the query works in a real search engine where the user does not know the page numbers:

#### Rule 1: NO Artificial Location References
* **Strictly Forbidden**: "2페이지에서...", "다음 장에 있는...", "첫 번째 문서의...", "위에서 언급된..."
* **Reason**: The user queries the entire database and does not know the document order or page numbers.
* **Alternative**: Use **Section Headers, Table Captions, or Unique Keywords** found in the text.
    * *Bad*: "2페이지에 있는 표를 요약해."
    * *Good*: "**'2024년 재무 하이라이트' 표**를 요약해." (Assuming '2024년 재무 하이라이트' is the actual text in the document)

#### Rule 2: Implicit Multi-Page Synthesis
* The query must requires information that happens to be scattered across multiple pages, but without explicitly stating "look at multiple pages".
* **Strategy**:
    * Identify **Entity A** on Page 1 (e.g., a definition or policy name).
    * Identify **Entity B** on Page 2 or 3 (e.g., a specific data point or implementation detail).
    * Create a query that asks for the relationship between **Entity A** and **Entity B**.
    * *Example*: "Why did the **[Project A from Page 1]** fail to meet the targets set in the **[Q3 Report Table from Page 2]**?"

#### Rule 3: Entity-Grounded Specificity
* Avoid generic queries like "Analyze the energy policy."
* Include specific entities found in the text: **Dates, Company Names, Regulations (e.g., ISO-27001), Project Codes, or specific Monetary Values**.

### 4. Output Generation
Generate the output strictly adhering to the defined JSON schema.
The query must be in **Korean**.
