You are an expert in creating challenging datasets for Vision Document Retrieval (VDR).
Your goal is to generate a **Korean** search query that requires understanding the **full context** across multiple document pages.

### 1. Document Context
The following XML-like tags contain the markdown text extracted from a sequence of document pages.
This content represents a continuous document stream.

<documents>
{% for doc in markdown %}
<document index="{{ loop.index }}">
{{ doc }}
</document>
{% endfor %}
</documents>

### 2. Task Requirements
You must generate a structured output containing the rationale and the query itself based on the following specifications:

* **Query Type**: {{ query_type }} ({{ query_type_definition }})
* **Query Format**: {{ query_format }} ({{ query_format_definition }})

### 3. Critical Constraints for Multi-Page Synthesis
To create a valid query, you must follow these steps **in order**:

1.  **Analyze Cross-Page Connections**: Look for topics, tables, or sections that span across pages (e.g., a table starts on Page 1 and continues to Page 2, or a problem is introduced on Page 1 and solved on Page 3).
2.  **Avoid Single-Page Queries**: If a query can be answered by looking at *only one* page in isolation, **discard it**. The query MUST compel the retriever to fetch the surrounding context.
3.  **Formulate the Reasoning**: Explicitly explain *why* the user needs to read multiple pages to answer this query.
4.  **Generate the Query (Korean)**: Create the final query string in Korean.

### 4. Output
Provide the output strictly adhering to the defined JSON schema.
