This pipeline is inspired by the [ViDoRe V3](https://huggingface.co/blog/QuentinJG/introducing-vidore-v3), and we thank the original authors for their foundational work. We also extend our gratitude to the [NVIDIA NeMo Data Designer](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/DataDesigner) team for open-sourcing their library. Finally, We thank the [Upstage x AWS AI Initiative](https://www.upstage.ai/events/ai-initiative-2025-ko) for granting us free access to their API services.

We also acknowledge the datasets provided by the [Public Data Portal(공공데이터포털)](https://www.data.go.kr/index.do), which were utilized to construct the tasks in KoViDoRe v2.
